## Hi, Welcome!

I'm a software development student who loves the vastness of technology and who is always looking to be better than yesterday!

‚Ä¢ Currently focused on **Javascript** stack for front and back-end;
<br/>‚Ä¢ Enthusiast about the best web & mobile development technologies;
<br/>‚Ä¢ I love to talk about: Programming, Science, Astronomy, Music;
<br/>‚Ä¢ Curious fact: I am also Tourismologist graduated from PUCRS and I worked hard in the area for the last 5 years.

I believe that if programming is the language of the future, we women should be part of this construction üë©‚Äçüíª
