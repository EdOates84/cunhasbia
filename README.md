## Hi, Welcome!

I'm a software development student who loves the vastness of technology and who is always looking to be better than yesterday!

• Currently focused on **Javascript** stack;
<br/>• Enthusiast about the best web & mobile development technologies;
<br/>• I love to talk about: Programming, Science, Astronomy;
<br/>• Curious fact: I am also Tourismologist graduated from PUCRS and I worked hard in the area for the last 5 years.
